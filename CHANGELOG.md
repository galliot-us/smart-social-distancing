## [0.1.0](https://github.com/neuralet/smart-social-distancing/releases/tag/0.1.0)

This is the first release of the Smart Social Distancing app.
The app is dockerized and can run on Coral Dev Board, Coral USB Accelerator, Jetson Nano, x86 or Openvino.
It supports close contact detection, occupancy alerts and facemask detection on multiple video sources.

It also includes a frontend React App and a separate backend that manages some endpoints which both have been **deprecated** and will be removed in future versions.
